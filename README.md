The bemPyLab series of lessons is part of a university course (Mathematical Modelling of Lifting Flows, Winter Semester 2020-21) by Prof. K.A. Belibassakis at the National Technical University of Athens. The first version will begin in October 2020 and these Jupyter Notebooks are prepared for the e-class, with assistance from the PhD student Dimitra Anevlavi. Any revisions will be added during this semester, adding student assignments to strengthen the overall learning experience.
