The *bemPyLab* series of lessons is part of a university course (Mathematical Modelling of Lifting Flows, Winter Semester 2020-21) by Prof. K.A. Belibassakis at the National Technical University of Athens. The first version began in October 2020 and these Jupyter Notebooks were prepared for the e-class, with assistance from the PhD student Dimitra Anevlavi. Any revisions will be added during this semester, adding student assignments to strengthen the overall learning experience.

## Module 0: Visualization of vector fields
TODO

## Module 1: Numerical methods in a nutshell

- [tutorial1_fdm](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/demieane/bemPyLab/blob/master/tutorial1_fdm.ipynb): For those who are not familiar with the Python programming language, and quite a bit rusty in terms of using the finite difference method (perhaps the holy grail of numerical methods for solving PDEs).

**Module 2: Basic 2D fluid flows**
Assignment01

- Rankine oval
- Source and sink pair
