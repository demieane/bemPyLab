The bemPyLab series of lessons is part of a university course (Mathematical Modelling of Lifting Flows, Winter Semester 2020-21) by Prof. K.A. Belibassakis at the National Technical University of Athens. The first version will begin in October 2020 and these Jupyter Notebooks are prepared for the e-class, with assistance from the PhD student Dimitra Anevlavi. Any revisions will be added during this semester, adding student assignments to strengthen the overall learning experience.

**Module 1: Numerical methods in a nutshell**

- [tutorial1_fdm](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/demieane/bemPyLab/blob/master/tutorial1_fdm.ipynb): For those who are not familiar with the Python programming language, and quite a bit rusty in terms of using the finite difference method (perhaps the holy grail of numerical methods for solving PDEs).

**Module 2: Boundary element methods for the Laplace equation in 2D**

- tutorial2.1: The interior Laplace problem in 2D with Dirichlet boundary conditions - laplace2d_dirichlet01.py
- tutorial2.2: The interior Laplace problem in 2D with Neumann boundary conditions - laplace2d_neumann01.py

**Module 3: Source-panel method for the prediction of wave resistance of a bluff body**
