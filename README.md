The *bemPyLab* series of lessons is part of a university course (Mathematical Modelling of Lifting Flows, Winter Semester 2020-21) by Prof. K.A. Belibassakis at the National Technical University of Athens. The first version began in October 2020 and these Jupyter Notebooks were prepared for the e-class, with assistance from the PhD student Dimitra Anevlavi. Any revisions will be added during this semester, adding student assignments to strengthen the overall learning experience.

## List of Notebooks

### 0. Getting Started

- [tutorial1_fdm](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/demieane/bemPyLab/blob/master/tutorial1_fdm.ipynb): For those who are not familiar with the Python programming language, and quite a bit rusty in terms of using the finite difference method (perhaps the holy grail of numerical methods for solving PDEs).

### Module 1: Elementary potential flows

- Rankine oval
- Source and sink pair
- [Superposition principle](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/demieane/bemPyLab/blob/master/L3_superposition_principle.ipynb)

### Module 2: Source panel methods 
Application of BEM for the wave resistance problem of a bluff body

### Module 3: Source-vortex panel methods
Hess-Smith method for 2D lifting flows
(Assignment - Compare the results obtained with BEM with thin airfoil theory, [XFOIL](https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/) and experimental data found in literature)

### Module 4: Vortex Lattice Method (VLM)
Hydrodynamic load prediction for 3D lifting flows around wings
(Assignment - Compare the results obtained with VLM with lifting-line theory)

### Module 5: Greens theorem-based BEM for 2D Laplace

- tutorial2.1: The interior Laplace problem in 2D with Dirichlet boundary conditions - laplace2d_dirichlet01.py
- tutorial2.2: The interior Laplace problem in 2D with Neumann boundary conditions - laplace2d_neumann01.py

### Module 6: Morino Method

### Module 7: Advanced topics 
- Singular integral calculation
- Higher-order BEMs
