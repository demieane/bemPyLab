# bemPyLab

The bemPyLab series of lessons is part of a university course (Mathematical Modelling of Lifting Flows, Winter Semester 2020-21) by Prof. K.A. Belibassakis at the National Technical University of Athens. The first version will begin in October 2020 and these Jupyter Notebooks are prepared for that class, with assistance from the PhD student Dimitra Anevlavi. Any revisions will be added during this semester, adding student assignments to strengthen the learning experience.
